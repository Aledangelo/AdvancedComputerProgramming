# Book Exams
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aledangelo/AdvancedComputerProgramming/main/BookExams/diagram.png)
Multithreaded server application for booking exam sessions. A multithreaded server created through a pool of 5 threads accepts booking requests, and implements the *boolean book(int id)*. At each request, the id are stored in a circular queue of size 10 which acts as a temporary buffer. A dedicated thread (implemented on the server side, StorageThread) empties the queue at regular intervals of 5 seconds and stores the freshmen in the *list-reserved.txt* file. Access to the queue is managed in mutual exclusion.
The server must provide 2 booking methods: booking without and with limitation to the maximum number of booked. The book operation returns a true (reservation made) or false (reservation not made) outcome as indicated below. In the unrestricted mode, each request is put on hold until a seat is free in the queue: all booking requests end with a true outcome. In the case with limitation, if the queue is full, the operation ends immediately with a false result without waiting further.
The client application generates 10 threads. Each thread sends 5 requests (the freshmen sent to the server are generated randomly) with a frequency of 1 request per second.
Communication between client and server takes place via sockets. The application must be made using the proxy-skeleton design pattern.
