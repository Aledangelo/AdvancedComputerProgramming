# Remote Printer
Remote printer management system. The system consists of 3 types of entities:
* **Dispatcher**: offers the *addPrinter* and *printRequest* services. The first, addPrinter, allows the addition of a Printer to the Dispatcher. The Dispatcher keeps a list of registered Printers. The printRequest method allows the request to print the docName document. For each invocation of printRequest, the Dispatcher calls one by one the Printers available in the list, until one is found that does not return false. If all Printers return false, printRequest will return false to Node.
* **Printer**: offers the print (String docName) method. Each Printer can perform only one print concurrently. If Printer is already executing a request, the invocation of print ends immediately with a false result. Otherwise, print i) prints to the screen and saves to docName file and ii) returns true result. A print invocation lasts a randomly chosen time between 5 and 10 seconds.
* **Node**: emulates a client that requires documents to be printed. Node starts 5 threads. Each thread calls 3 printRequest -with randomly generated docName- every 3 seconds (the docName string is generated by concatenating the prefix “doc” and a random integer between 1 and 50).

It iss implemented using Java RMI for the Dispatcher and socket (proxy / skeleton pattern and implementation by proxy) for the interaction between Dispatcher and Printer.
