# Remote Whiteboard
The whiteboard can accept a number of shapes (*Triangle* & *Square*).
There are three methods: 
* **addShape**: allows you to add a shape on the blackboard
* **getShape**: allows you to see the current state of the whiteboard to see how many and which drawings there are on the remote object
* **attachObserver**: the attachObserver is used to define to the server which are the callback objects to be notified of the status of the whiteboard

### How to use!
To execute the code you need to use the **rmiregistry** command inside the bin folder of the project!
