# Remote Alert
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aledangelo/AdvancedComputerProgramming/main/RemoteAlert/diagram.png)

System for the distribution of alert notifications (represented by instances of AlertNotification), generated by remote components. The system consists of the following entities:
* **Generator**: Start 3 threads; each thread invokes *sendNotification* on Manager (Java RMI invocation) passing an instance of *AlertNotification*. The value of the componentID field (integer) of the AlertNotification instance is randomly chosen between 1 and 5; criticality (integer) is randomly chosen between 1 and 3.
* **Subscriber**: Waits from Manager to produce alerts associated with a specific componentID. For this purpose, Subscriber, at its start, subscribes to the Manager by invoking the subscribe method (Java RMI invocation) and passing: 1) componentID (integer, i.e. the ID of the component for which the Subscriber intends to receive alerts) and 2) port number, used by the Manager to subsequently contact the Subscriber via socket, as specified below.
* **Manager**: Exposes the Java RMI *subscribe* and *sendNotification* methods. For each subscribe, the Manager stores the subscription data received from a Subscriber. At each *sendNotification*, the Manager verifies the componentID value contained in the received *AlertNotification* instance: in the event that there are one (or more) Subscriber subscribed to that componentID, they will be notified by the Manager by invoking notifyAlert.

The invocation of *notifyAlert* takes place via proxy and socket: the *notifyAlert* method requires only the criticality value (integer) in input. This value is printed on the screen and saved on a file on the Subscriber side. Manager's *sendNotification* method runs in mutual exclusion.
