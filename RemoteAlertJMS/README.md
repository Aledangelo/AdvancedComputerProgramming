# Remote Alert
System for the distribution of alert notifications, generated by remote components. The system consists of the following entities:
* **Client**: Start 3 threads; each thread invokes sendNotification on Manager passing the componentID field (integer), randomly chosen between 1 and 5,  and criticality (integer), randomly chosen between 1 and 3.
* **Subscriber**: Waits from Manager to produce alerts associated with a specific componentID. For this purpose, Subscriber, at its start, subscribes to the Manager by invoking the subscribe method  and passing: 1) componentID (integer, i.e. the ID of the component for which the Subscriber intends to receive alerts) and 2) port number, used by the Manager to subsequently contact the Subscriber via socket, as specified below.
* **Manager**: For each subscribe, the Manager stores the subscription data received from a Subscriber. At each sendNotification, the Manager verifies the componentID value: in the event that there are one (or more) Subscriber subscribed to that componentID, they will be notified by the Manager by invoking notifyAlert.
